## Example Workflows

### Triaging an Incoming Ticket

```
You: /triage Customer says their dashboard has been showing a blank
     page since this morning — they're on the Enterprise plan

Agent: Analyzing the issue...

## Triage: Dashboard blank page — Enterprise customer

**Category:** Bug
**Priority:** P2 — High (core feature broken, enterprise customer)
**Product area:** Dashboard / Frontend

### Routing Recommendation
Route to: Tier 2 Support (investigate browser/account specifics,
then escalate to Engineering if reproducible)

### Suggested Initial Response
[Draft acknowledging the issue, asking clarifying questions
about browser and any recent changes, offering status page link]
```

### Researching a Customer Question

```
You: /research Does our platform support SSO with Okta?

Agent: Let me check across available sources...

[Searches docs, knowledge base, previous conversations,
 and web sources — synthesizes answer with confidence
 level and source attribution]
```

### Packaging an Escalation

```
You: /escalate API returning 500 errors intermittently — 3
     Enterprise customers reported this week

Agent: I'll gather context and build the escalation brief...

[Pulls ticket history, identifies affected accounts,
 structures reproduction steps, assesses business impact,
 and generates a structured escalation for engineering]
```

### Drafting a Response

```
You: /draft-response Customer escalation — their integration
     has been down for 2 days and they're frustrated

Agent: [Generates empathetic, professional response acknowledging
 the frustration, taking ownership, providing a clear action
 plan with timeline, and offering a call]
```

### Writing a KB Article

```
You: /kb-article How to configure webhook notifications —
     just resolved this for the third customer this month

Agent: [Generates a structured how-to article with prerequisites,
 step-by-step instructions, verification steps, and common
 issues — optimized for search]
```

## Configuration

For the richest experience, connect data sources via tool connectors (MCP servers or equivalent):

1. **Support platform**: Add your ticketing system for ticket history and customer context
2. **Knowledge base**: Add your wiki for internal documentation and existing KB articles
3. **Project tracker**: Add your issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests
4. **CRM**: Add your CRM for account details and contact information

Without these connections, the agent will ask you to provide context manually and offer frameworks and templates you can fill in with your own data.
